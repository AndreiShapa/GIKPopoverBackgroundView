# GIKPopoverBackgroundView

GIKPopoverBackgroundView is a UIPopoverBackgroundView subclass which uses images similar to those found in UIKit to customise the background of a UIPopoverController.

Unlike most other third-party implementations, GIKPopoverBackgroundView doesn't use separate arrow images, so the  appearance is seamless for all orientations.

## Source Images

The figure below shows the background images used by Apple's default implementation:

<img src="https://github.com/GiK/GIKPopoverBackgroundView/raw/gh-pages/AppleDefaultBackgroundImages.png" alt="Images making up Apple's default UIPopoverController background" title="Shared artwork images" style="display:block; margin: 10px auto 30px auto;" class="center">

The DownRight, UpRight, SideBottom, and SideTop images are used when the popover is anchored to a control or rect in the corner or edge of a view. A point in the solid dark blue area is defined as the stretchable region using standard `UIEdgeInsets`.

The Down, Up, and Side images require special handling. To draw a background with an up arrow centered horizontally, the Up image must be stretched twice - once on either side of the arrow.

### Measure once, stretch twice

Unsurprisingly, judicious use of UIImage's `-resizableImageWithCapInsets:` method is made throughout. What might not be apparent, however, is that naively applying cap insets twice won't work. Specifying a stretchable region doesn't affect the underlying image until it's drawn into a context or a view.

The approach taken in GIKPopoverBackgroundView is to draw a stretchable image into a bitmap-based graphics context with appropriate size:

``` objective-c
- (UIImage *)imageFromImageContextWithSourceImage:(UIImage *)image size:(CGSize)size
{
  UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(size, NO, 0.0);
  [image drawInRect:(CGRect){ .origin = CGPointZero, .size = size }];
  UIImage *result = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
  UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
  return result;
}
```

A second set of cap insets are added to the resultant image and it's this new resizable image which is applied to the popover background's `UIImageView`.

### Mirror, mirror

The same technique is used for popover backgrounds with left-facing or 'UpLeft' and 'DownLeft' arrows. The source image is flipped horizontally and drawn into a bitmap-based graphics context before having cap insets applied:

``` objective-c
- (UIImage *)mirroredImage:(UIImage *)image
{
  UIImage *mirror = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:image.CGImage scale:[[UIScreen mainScreen] scale] orientation:UIImageOrientationUpMirrored];
  return [self imageFromImageContextWithSourceImage:mirror size:mirror.size];
}
```

### Drop shadows and iOS 5.x

Background drop shadows don't appear to work on subclasses of UIPopoverBackgroundView if the deployment target is iOS 5.x. In this instance, a drop shadow is drawn using the `shadowPath` property of the background's layer.

The `shadowPath` property of `CALayer` doesn't respond to implicit animations such as changes to a layer's bounds. As such, we must use an explicit animation to animate the shadow as the popover background's geometry is changing.

The documentation for `UIPopoverBackgroundView` states that `-setArrowOffset:` is called inside an animation block managed by the UIPopoverController. This would seem to be the ideal place to sync  the bounds and shadowPath animations. When `setArrowOffset:` is called, we check the `animationKeys` array of the layer for a `bounds` key. If one is found, then we know the background's frame is changing - possibly as the result of the keyboard appearing/disappearing. We can apply the `timingFunction` and `duration` properties of the bounds animation to a new `CABasicAnimation` for the `shadowPath`.

``` objective-c
- (void)addShadowPathAnimationIfNecessary:(CGPathRef)pathRef
{
  NSArray *animationKeys = [self.popoverBackground.layer animationKeys];
  if ([animationKeys containsObject:@"bounds"])
  {
	  CAAnimation *boundsAnimation = [self.popoverBackground.layer animationForKey:@"bounds"];
	  CABasicAnimation *shadowPathAnimation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"shadowPath"];
	  shadowPathAnimation.toValue = [NSValue valueWithPointer:pathRef];
	  shadowPathAnimation.timingFunction = boundsAnimation.timingFunction;
	  shadowPathAnimation.duration = boundsAnimation.duration;
	  [self.popoverBackground.layer addAnimation:shadowPathAnimation forKey:@"shadowPath"];
  }
}
```
